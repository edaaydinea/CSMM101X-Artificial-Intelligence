 This repository is included my python projects which I studied in Artificial Intelligence for MicroMaster at Columbia University.
 
 Project Explanation of Artificial Intelligence Course

1. Week 2 Project - Search Algorithms 
   - This project relates to creating an agent to solve the 8-puzzle game.
   
2. Week 4 Project - Adversarial Search and Games 
   - This project relates to creating an agent to intelligantly play the 2048-puzzle game.

3. Week 7 Projects
   - (1) Perceptron Learning Algorithm 
      - This project relates to implementing the PLA for linearly separable dataset.
   - (2) Linear Regression
      - This project relates to working on the linear regression with multiple features using gradient descent.
   - (3) Classification 
      - This project relates to working on the support vector classifiers to learn a classification model for a chessboard
         
4. Week 9 Project - Constraint Satisfaction Problems
    - This project relates to implementing the AC-3 Aand backtracking algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles.

5. Week 11 Project - NLP
